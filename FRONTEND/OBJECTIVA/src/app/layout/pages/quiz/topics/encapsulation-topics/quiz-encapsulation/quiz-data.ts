            d: "Hiding methods from other classes.",
            correct: "a",
            explanation: "Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit. It is used to hide the internal state of an object and restrict access to the object's data."

            d: "A class with only public attributes.",
            correct: "a",
            explanation: "A bank account with a private balance and public methods to deposit and withdraw money is an example of encapsulation. The private balance is hidden from direct access and can only be modified through the public methods."

            d: "Mobile phone with hidden components.",
            correct: "c",
            explanation: "A bank account with a private balance, an ATM system hiding hardware details, and a mobile phone with hidden components are real-world examples of encapsulation. Public variables shared globally do not demonstrate encapsulation as they are not hidden or protected."

            d: "It provides global variables.",
            correct: "b",
            explanation: "Encapsulation is important for reusability because it ensures that code is independent of internal changes. By hiding the internal state of an object, encapsulation allows objects to be used without knowing how they are implemented."

            d: "Only static methods.",
            correct: "b",
            explanation: "A key characteristic of encapsulated classes is that they have methods to control data access. By using getters and setters, encapsulated classes can provide controlled access to their private data."
        },
        {
            question: "Why should fields in an encapsulated class be private?",
            a: "To restrict unauthorized access.",
